# mini-reactive-js-framework
Homemade minimalistic and reactive js framework. The idea of creating one is to improve my js skills and dive deeper into the concepts of creating your own frameworks and  reactivity used in modern js frameworks. This time I wanted to create a tool for dev, not to use existing tools like react, vue or angular.
